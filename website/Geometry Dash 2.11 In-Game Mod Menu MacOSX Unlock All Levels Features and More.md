## Step 2: Extract the Zip File
 
The next step is to extract the zip file that you downloaded in the previous step. To do this, you need to use a tool that can unzip files on your Mac, such as The Unarchiver or WinZip. You can download these tools from the App Store or from their official websites.
 
Once you have installed one of these tools, you need to locate the zip file that you downloaded and right-click on it. Then, select the option to open it with the tool that you installed. This will extract the zip file and create a folder with the same name as the zip file.
 
## Step 3: Move the Mod Menu Files to the Geometry Dash Folder
 
The third step is to move the mod menu files that you extracted in the previous step to the Geometry Dash folder on your Mac. To do this, you need to locate the Geometry Dash folder on your Mac. The default location of this folder is /Users/YourUsername/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Geometry Dash.
 
If you cannot find this folder, you can use Spotlight or Finder to search for it. Alternatively, you can right-click on the Geometry Dash app icon and select Show Package Contents. This will open a new window with a folder named Contents. Inside this folder, you will find another folder named MacOS. This is where you need to move the mod menu files.
 
To move the mod menu files, you need to drag and drop them from the folder that you extracted in the previous step to the MacOS folder inside the Geometry Dash folder. You may need to enter your administrator password or grant permission to do this.
 
## Step 4: Run the Mod Menu App
 
The final step is to run the mod menu app that you moved in the previous step. To do this, you need to double-click on the Geometry Dash 2.11 In-Game Mod Menu MacOSX.app file inside the MacOS folder inside the Geometry Dash folder. This will launch the mod menu app and open a new window with a list of cheats and hacks that you can use while playing Geometry Dash.
