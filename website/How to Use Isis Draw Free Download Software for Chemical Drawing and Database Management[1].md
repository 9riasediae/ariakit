## What is Isis Draw?
 
Isis Draw is a software developed by MDL Information Systems (now part of Dassault SystÃ¨mes) that allows users to draw and edit chemical structures and reactions. It has many features such as:
 
- Support for various chemical formats such as SMILES, InChI, Molfile, etc.
- Ability to create complex structures such as polymers, organometallics, biomolecules, etc.
- Tools for drawing reaction schemes and mechanisms.
- Integration with other software such as ChemOffice, ChemDraw, etc.
- Export options for various formats such as PDF, PNG, SVG, etc.

Isis Draw was first released in 1996 and was updated until 2007. However, since then, it has been discontinued and replaced by a newer software called ChemSketch.
 
## What is ChemSketch?
 
ChemSketch is a software developed by Advanced Chemistry Development (ACD/Labs) that is similar to Isis Draw but with more features and improvements. It is also a software for creating and editing chemical structures and reactions. Some of the features of ChemSketch are:

- Support for more chemical formats such as CML, RXNfile, etc.
- Ability to create 3D structures and view them in different modes such as ball-and-stick, space-filling, etc.
- Tools for calculating molecular properties such as molecular weight, formula, charge, etc.
- Integration with other software such as ChemSpider, PubChem, etc.
- Export options for more formats such as HTML5, EPS, WMF, etc.

ChemSketch was first released in 1998 and is still being updated regularly. It is also available in two versions: a freeware version and a commercial version. The freeware version has some limitations such as:

- A maximum of 50 atoms per structure.
- No support for advanced features such as stereochemistry, templates, etc.
- No technical support or updates.

The commercial version has no limitations and offers more features and benefits such as:

- A unlimited number of atoms per structure.
- Support for advanced features such as stereochemistry, templates, etc.
- Technical support and updates.
- Access to more databases and resources such as NMR Predictor, Name to Structure Generator, etc.

The commercial version of ChemSketch costs $995 USD per year for a single user license. However, there are discounts available for academic institutions and students.
