To crack Battlefield 4 PC game, you will need to download and install a cracked version of the game from a reliable source. One of the best sources is SKiDROW CODEX[^1^], which provides a RELOADED release of Battlefield 4 with all the expansion packs and updates included. The RELOADED release is based on the official Origin version of the game, so it has high compatibility and performance. The size of the download is about 23 GB, and you can use a torrent client or direct links to get it.
 
After downloading the RELOADED release, you will need to extract it using a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip. Then, you will need to mount the ISO file using a virtual drive software like Daemon Tools or PowerISO. Next, you will need to run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions to install the game on your PC. You can choose the installation directory and language according to your preference. The installation process may take some time depending on your system specifications.
 
Once the installation is complete, you will need to copy the contents of the Crack folder from the ISO file to the game installation directory. This will overwrite the original files and apply the crack. You can also use a firewall to block the game from accessing the internet and prevent any potential issues. Now, you can run the game from the desktop shortcut or the game executable file and enjoy playing Battlefield 4 PC game for free.
 
If you want to play Battlefield 4 multiplayer mode with other cracked players, you will need to use a special emulator called ZLOEmu[^2^]. This emulator allows you to connect to ZLO servers and play online with other users who have cracked the game. To use ZLOEmu, you will need to register an account on their website and download their client files. Then, you will need to follow some additional steps to set up ZLOEmu and Origin on your PC. You can find more details and instructions on their website or on Reddit[^2^].
 
However, please note that cracking Battlefield 4 PC game is illegal and may violate the terms of service of Origin and EA. It may also expose your PC to malware or viruses that can harm your system or data. Therefore, we do not recommend cracking Battlefield 4 PC game or any other game for that matter. If you like Battlefield 4 PC game and want to support its developers, you should buy it from a legitimate source like Steam or Origin.

Besides the multiplayer mode, Battlefield 4 also has a single-player campaign that follows a squad of US Marines as they try to rescue VIPs and prevent a war with China. The campaign is a linear, scripted, and cinematic experience that showcases the impressive graphics and physics of the Frostbite 3 engine. However, it also suffers from a lack of originality, creativity, and depth. The story is clichÃ©d and predictable, the characters are bland and stereotypical, and the gameplay is repetitive and scripted. The campaign is also very short, lasting only about 5 hours on normal difficulty.
 
The campaign does have some moments of excitement and spectacle, such as a car chase through a collapsing city, a stealth mission on a sinking aircraft carrier, and a final showdown on a rooftop. However, these moments are few and far between, and they are overshadowed by the numerous flaws and bugs that plague the campaign. The AI is dumb and unreliable, the checkpoints are poorly placed and inconsistent, the dialogue is cheesy and awkward, and the game often crashes or freezes. The campaign feels like an afterthought, a mandatory feature that was rushed and poorly executed.

You can customize your soldier's class, loadout, appearance, and skills.
