Addictive Drums is a popular drum software that allows you to create realistic and expressive drum tracks. However, sometimes you may encounter authorization issues that prevent you from using the software properly. This article will explain some common causes and solutions for Addictive Drums authorization problems.
 
## Wrong Computer ID or Instrument in Trial Mode
 
If your Addictive Drums product suddenly goes to trial mode, it means that something in your computer triggered a change in the Computer ID (perhaps a software or hardware update). This in turn deauthorizes your product. This is easy to fix:

2. Go to the My Account section and select Computers from the left side menu
3. Remove your current computer
4. Run the XLN Online Installer and re-register your computer
5. Now the software should be properly authorized.

If it's still not working (and you're on a Windows computer) then it is possible that you are running your DAW in compatibility mode, which interferes with the authorization. Right-click on the DAW icon > Properties > Compatibility tab. Then deactivate Compatibility mode if activated and try again. Do the same for the Online Installer.
