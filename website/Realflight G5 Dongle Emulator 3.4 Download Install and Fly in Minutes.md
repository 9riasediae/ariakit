Realflight G5 is a popular RC flight simulator that allows you to practice flying different models of RC planes and helicopters on your computer. However, to use Realflight G5, you need a special USB dongle that connects to your transmitter and acts as a license key. If you don't have the dongle, or if you want to use a different transmitter, you can use a software called Realflight G5 Dongle Emulator 3.4.
 
Realflight G5 Dongle Emulator 3.4 is a program that mimics the function of the original dongle and lets you use any transmitter that supports PPM signal with Realflight G5. You can download Realflight G5 Dongle Emulator 3.4 from various sources on the internet[^1^] [^2^], but be careful as some of them may contain viruses or malware. You should always scan the files before running them on your computer.
