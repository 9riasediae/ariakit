Despite its intriguing premise and talented crew, The Keep was a commercial and critical failure when it was released. It suffered from studio interference, poor editing, and negative reviews. It has never been officially released on DVD or Blu-ray, and only exists in low-quality bootlegs and torrents. However, some fans and critics have rediscovered The Keep over the years and have praised it for its atmospheric visuals, unique story, and cult appeal.

The Keep is not a typical horror film, but rather a dark and surreal exploration of human nature, history, and mythology. It is a film that challenges its viewers to question their own beliefs and morality, as well as the nature of good and evil. It is a film that deserves more recognition and appreciation than it has received so far. It is a film that will stay with you long after you watch it.
  
The Keep was a troubled production from the start, as Mann faced various challenges and conflicts while making the film. He had to deal with harsh weather conditions, budget constraints, creative differences with the studio, and the death of his special effects supervisor, Wally Veevers, who passed away before completing his work on the film. Mann also had a difficult relationship with some of his cast members, especially Scott Glenn, who played Glaeken Trismegestus, a mysterious being who is summoned to stop Molasar. Glenn later said that he felt "abused" by Mann on the set, and that he did not understand his character or the film's plot.

Mann's original vision for The Keep was much longer and more complex than the version that was released in theaters. He had shot over three hours of footage, which he edited down to a 210-minute director's cut. However, Paramount Pictures, the film's distributor, demanded that he cut the film down to 120 minutes, which he reluctantly did. The studio then tested this version with audiences, who reacted negatively to it. The studio then decided to cut the film even further, to its final 96-minute version, which Mann disowned.
 
The Keep has never been officially released on DVD or Blu-ray in any region, and only exists in low-quality VHS and LaserDisc copies. The film's soundtrack by Tangerine Dream was also never officially released, though bootleg versions have circulated among fans. Some fans have petitioned for a release of Mann's original director's cut, which he reportedly still has in his possession. However, Mann has shown little interest in revisiting the film, as he considers it a failure and a disappointment. He has also stated that restoring the film would be too costly and time-consuming, and that he would rather focus on his new projects.
