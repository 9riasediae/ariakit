# How to Crack WinPLC7 V5 Software for VIPA PLCs
 
WinPLC7 V5 is a programming software for VIPA PLCs, which are compatible with Siemens S7 PLCs. WinPLC7 V5 allows you to create, edit, test and debug PLC programs using a graphical user interface. However, WinPLC7 V5 is not a free software and requires a license key to activate it. If you want to use WinPLC7 V5 without paying for a license, you can try to crack it using some tools and techniques.
 
In this article, we will show you how to crack WinPLC7 V5 software for VIPA PLCs using a hex editor and a key generator. Please note that this is for educational purposes only and we do not condone piracy or illegal use of software. You should always respect the intellectual property rights of the software developers and purchase a legitimate license if you want to use WinPLC7 V5 software.

## Step 1: Download and install WinPLC7 V5 software
 
The first step is to download and install WinPLC7 V5 software from the official website of VIPA USA[^2^]. You can choose the version that suits your operating system (Windows 10 compatible or prior version). The download size is about 63 MB. After downloading the software, run the setup file and follow the instructions to install it on your computer.

## Step 2: Download and install a hex editor
 
The next step is to download and install a hex editor, which is a tool that allows you to view and edit the binary data of any file. There are many hex editors available online, such as HxD, Hex Workshop, UltraEdit, etc. You can choose any one that you like and download it from its official website. After downloading the hex editor, run the setup file and follow the instructions to install it on your computer.
 
## Step 3: Find and modify the license check code in WinPLC7 V5 executable file
 
The third step is to find and modify the license check code in WinPLC7 V5 executable file using the hex editor. The license check code is a piece of code that verifies if you have a valid license key or not. If you modify this code, you can bypass the license verification process and use WinPLC7 V5 software without a license key.
 
To do this, open the hex editor and open the WinPLC7 V5 executable file, which is usually located in C:\Program Files (x86)\VIPA\WinPLC7\ws7v5.exe. Then, search for the following hexadecimal string:

    83 F8 01 0F 85 9D 00 00 00

This string corresponds to the following assembly code:

    cmp eax,1
    jne 0000009D

This code compares the value of eax register with 1, which is the result of the license check function. If eax is not equal to 1 (jne), it jumps to another location (0000009D) where it displays an error message saying that you need a license key. To crack this code, we need to change jne (jump if not equal) to je (jump if equal), so that it jumps to the same location regardless of the value of eax. To do this, we need to change the hexadecimal value of jne from 85 to 84. So, replace the hexadecimal string with:

    83 F8 01 0F 84 9D 00 00 00

This string corresponds to the following assembly code:

    cmp eax,1
    je 0000009D

After replacing the string, save the file and close the hex editor.
 
## Step 4: Download and run a key generator
 
The final step is to download and run a key generator, which is a tool that generates random license keys for WinPLC
