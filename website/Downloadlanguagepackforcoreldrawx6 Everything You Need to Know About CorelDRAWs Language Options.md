CorelDRAW X6 is a powerful and versatile graphic design software that can help you create stunning logos, illustrations, flyers, brochures, web graphics, and more. With its intuitive and user-friendly interface, you can easily access and customize the tools and features you need for your projects. You can also work with multiple documents in a tabbed workspace, and use the Object Styles docker to manage the appearance and formatting of your objects.
 
One of the new features in CorelDRAW X6 is the ability to work with OpenType fonts, which offer more typographic options and control. You can apply advanced OpenType features such as ligatures, swashes, ornaments, and small caps to your text, and preview them in real time. You can also use the Font Playground docker to experiment with different fonts and styles before applying them to your document.
 
Another new feature in CorelDRAW X6 is the Color Harmony tool, which lets you create and modify color schemes based on color theory. You can choose from various harmony rules, such as complementary, triadic, or tetradic, and adjust the colors using sliders or color wheels. You can also save your color schemes as color styles and apply them to other objects in your document.

CorelDRAW X6 also introduces the Smart Carver tool, which lets you remove unwanted objects or areas from your photos without affecting the quality or composition. You can use the tool to mark the areas you want to keep or remove, and then adjust the size and shape of the photo.
