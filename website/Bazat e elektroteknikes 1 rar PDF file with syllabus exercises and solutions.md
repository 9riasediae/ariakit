The document can be downloaded as a PDF or TXT file, or read online from Scribd [^1^]. However, some users may encounter difficulties in accessing the document due to its file format. The document has a .rar extension, which stands for Roshal Archive. This is a compressed file format that reduces the size of the original file and allows multiple files to be stored in one archive. To open a .rar file, one needs a special software such as WinRAR or 7-Zip [^3^]. Alternatively, one can use an online tool such as Unrar Online or CloudConvert to extract the files from the archive [^3^].
 
Bazat e Elektroteknikes is a useful resource for electrical engineering students who want to review the basic concepts and principles of the field. It can also help them prepare for exams and tests by providing them with sample questions and solutions. However, users should be aware of the file format and the software requirements before downloading or opening the document.

Electrical engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, analysis, and application of electrical and electronic systems. Electrical engineers work on a variety of projects, such as power generation and distribution, communication networks, robotics, sensors, microelectronics, and more. Electrical engineering is a broad and diverse field that requires a solid foundation in mathematics, physics, and engineering principles .
 
One of the core topics in electrical engineering is circuit analysis. A circuit is a network of electrical components that are connected by wires or traces to form a closed loop. The components can be resistors, capacitors, inductors, switches, diodes, transistors, and more. The behavior of a circuit depends on the voltage and current that flow through it. Voltage is the potential difference between two points in a circuit, and current is the rate of flow of electric charge. Power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred or dissipated in a circuit .
 
To analyze a circuit, electrical engineers use various methods and tools, such as Kirchhoff's laws, Ohm's law, Thevenin's theorem, Norton's theorem, superposition principle, mesh analysis, nodal analysis, and more. These methods help them find the equivalent resistance, voltage, current, and power of any element or branch in a circuit. They also help them simplify complex circuits into simpler ones for easier analysis .
 
Another important topic in electrical engineering is amplifiers. An amplifier is a device that increases the amplitude or power of an input signal without changing its shape or frequency. Amplifiers are used to boost weak signals for transmission or processing. For example, amplifiers are used in audio systems, radio receivers, radars, oscilloscopes, and more. Amplifiers can be classified into different types based on their input and output characteristics, such as voltage amplifiers, current amplifiers, power amplifiers, etc .
 
One of the most common types of amplifiers is the operational amplifier (op-amp). An op-amp is a high-gain differential amplifier that has two inputs (inverting and non-inverting) and one output. An op-amp can perform various mathematical operations on its input signals, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, integration, differentiation, etc. An op-amp can also be configured to perform various functions such as filters, comparators, oscillators, etc., by adding external components such as resistors and capacitors .
