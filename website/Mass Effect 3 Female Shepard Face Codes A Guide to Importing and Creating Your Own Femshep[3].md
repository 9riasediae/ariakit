# How to Customize Your Female Shepard in Mass Effect 3 with Face Codes
 
Mass Effect 3 is a sci-fi role-playing game that lets you create your own version of Commander Shepard, the protagonist of the series. You can choose from various options such as gender, appearance, background, and personality to make your Shepard unique. One of the most important aspects of customization is the face, which determines how your Shepard looks in cutscenes and conversations.
 
While you can use the in-game character creator to tweak your Shepard's face, you may find it limited or tedious to use. Alternatively, you can use face codes, which are alphanumeric strings that represent the facial features of your Shepard. Face codes can be found online on various websites and forums, where other players share their creations. You can also generate your own face code by using the "Squad" menu in the game and selecting your Shepard.

To use a face code, you need to start a new game or import a save file from Mass Effect 2. Then, you need to select "Custom Female" as your gender option and enter the face code in the "Code" field at the bottom of the screen. You can then preview your Shepard's face and make any adjustments if needed. You can also change other aspects of your Shepard such as hair style, hair color, eye color, and makeup.

If you want to learn more about face codes and how they work, here are some facts and tips you may find useful:

1. Face codes are composed of 36 characters, divided into 12 groups of three. Each group corresponds to a facial feature such as nose shape, mouth width, brow height, etc. The first character in each group is a number from 1 to 9, indicating the preset value for that feature. The second and third characters are letters from A to Z, indicating the slider value for that feature.
2. Face codes are not compatible across different games in the Mass Effect series. For example, you cannot use a face code from Mass Effect 2 in Mass Effect 3, or vice versa. However, you can use a face code from Mass Effect 1 in Mass Effect 2 or 3, as long as you import your save file from the previous game.
3. Face codes are not affected by the gender of your Shepard. You can use a face code for a female Shepard on a male Shepard, or vice versa. However, some features may look different or unnatural due to the differences in facial structure and animation.
4. Face codes are not affected by the race of your Shepard. You can use a face code for a human Shepard on an alien Shepard, such as a turian or an asari. However, some features may not be visible or applicable due to the differences in facial anatomy and texture.
5. Face codes are not affected by the class of your Shepard. You can use a face code for a soldier Shepard on an engineer Shepard, or vice versa. However, some features may be obscured or altered by the armor and helmet options available for each class.
