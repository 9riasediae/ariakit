Quantum Chess is a game that combines the rules of chess with the principles of quantum mechanics. It was created by Chris Cantwell, a software engineer and quantum physics enthusiast, who wanted to make quantum phenomena more accessible and fun for everyone. Quantum Chess was featured in a viral video starring Paul Rudd and Stephen Hawking, where they played a match of the game online.

Quantum Chess is available on Steam as an early access game, which means it is still in development and may change over time. The game allows players to play offline or online against other players or the computer. The game also features a tutorial mode that explains the basics of quantum mechanics and how they affect the game.
 
Quantum Chess is different from regular chess in several ways. First, each piece has a quantum state, which means it can exist in a superposition of two or more classical states. For example, a pawn can be both a pawn and a queen at the same time, until it is observed by moving or capturing it. Second, each move has a probability of success, which depends on the quantum state of the piece and the board. For example, a knight can move to a square that is occupied by another piece, but there is a chance that the move will fail and the knight will stay where it is. Third, some moves can cause quantum entanglement, which means that two or more pieces share a quantum state and their fates are linked. For example, if two pawns are entangled and one of them is captured, the other one will also disappear.
 
Quantum Chess is a game that challenges players to think outside the box and explore the weird and wonderful world of quantum physics. It is also a game that can help players learn about quantum concepts and phenomena in a fun and interactive way. If you are interested in playing Quantum Chess, you can download it from Steam[^1^] or from SourceForge[^2^]. You can also visit the official website[^3^] for more information and updates.

## Quantum Games: A New Frontier for Gaming and Learning
 
Quantum games are games that use quantum physics as a theme, a mechanic, or a platform. They can be digital, analog, or hybrid, and they can have various purposes, such as entertainment, education, research, or outreach. Quantum games are a new and exciting way to explore the fascinating and often counterintuitive world of quantum phenomena, such as superposition, entanglement, interference, measurement, and uncertainty.
 
Quantum games can be classified into three dimensions, according to a recent study by Piispanen et al. [^2^]. The first dimension is the perceivable dimension of quantum physics, which refers to how quantum physics is represented or experienced in the game. For example, some games use quantum-inspired visuals or sounds, such as wave patterns or particle effects. Other games use quantum concepts or principles as gameplay elements, such as quantum moves or quantum puzzles. The second dimension is the dimension of quantum technologies, which refers to how quantum technologies are used or referenced in the game. For example, some games use quantum computers or simulators as platforms or tools to run the game logic or generate content. Other games use quantum devices or sensors as input or output devices, such as quantum random number generators or quantum cameras. The third dimension is the dimension of scientific purposes, which refers to how the game contributes to scientific knowledge or communication. For example, some games aim to teach or learn about quantum physics or quantum technologies, such as Quantum Chess [^1^] or QPlayLearn [^3^]. Other games aim to involve players in scientific research or innovation, such as ScienceAtHome [^3^] or Quantum Odyssey [^3^].
 
Quantum games are a new frontier for gaming and learning, as they offer novel and engaging ways to interact with quantum phenomena and technologies. They can also help players develop skills and competencies that are relevant for the future of science and society, such as critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, and curiosity. If you are interested in playing quantum games, you can find many examples and resources online [^3^], or you can join events and communities that promote quantum game development [^3^]. You can also create your own quantum games using various tools and platforms that are available for free [^3^]. Quantum games are not only fun and educational, but also potentially impactful and transformative for the world of gaming and beyond.
