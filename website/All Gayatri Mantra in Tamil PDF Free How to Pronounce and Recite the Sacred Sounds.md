The Gayatri mantra is composed of three parts: the praise (Bhur Bhuvah Svah), the meditation (Tat Savitur Varenyam), and the prayer (Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi Dhiyo Yo Nah Prachodayat). The praise invokes the cosmic forces that are responsible for life on earth. The meditation identifies and glorifies the supreme creator who is the source of all light and wisdom. The prayer expresses a sincere request to the divine power to awaken and strengthen our intellect, so that we may realize our true potential and fulfill our purpose in life[^2^].
 
The Gayatri mantra can be chanted for any deity, as it is not specific to any particular form or name. However, some devotees prefer to chant it with the name of their favorite god or goddess, to invoke their specific attributes and blessings. For example, some chant it with Ganesha for success and obstacle removal, some with Shiva for destruction of evil and ignorance, some with Vishnu for protection and preservation, some with Lakshmi for wealth and prosperity, some with Saraswati for knowledge and learning, some with Durga for power and courage, some with Hanuman for devotion and strength, and so on.

You should feel her presence in your heart chakra and seek her blessings.
- Chant with devotion and concentration. You should chant the Gayatri mantra with love and reverence for Gayatri Mata. You should also focus on the meaning and sound of each syllable of the mantra. You should avoid any distractions or interruptions while chanting. You should chant at least 108 times daily or as many times as you can.
