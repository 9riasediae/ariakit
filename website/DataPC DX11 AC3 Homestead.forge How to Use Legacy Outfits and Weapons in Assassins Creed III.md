Fortunately, there are some possible solutions to fix this issue and enjoy the game without problems. Here are some steps you can try:
 
1. Verify the integrity of game files. This can be done through Steam or Uplay, depending on where you bought the game. This will check if any files are missing or damaged and download them again.
2. Run the game as administrator. This can be done by right-clicking on the game's executable file or shortcut and choosing "Run as administrator". This will give the game more permissions to access and modify files.
3. Disable or whitelist your antivirus software. Some antivirus programs may falsely detect the game's files as malicious and prevent them from running. You can try disabling your antivirus temporarily or adding the game's folder to its exceptions list.
4. Delete the multi folder from %temp%. Some users have reported that deleting a folder named "multi" from their temporary files folder can fix the issue. To do this, open the Run dialog box by pressing Windows + R keys, type %temp% and hit Enter. Then look for folders like 9D15E813-0C26-41E7-ABC5-3EB06FF1B3CF and delete only the Disk1\deltaFiles\multi folder from each one.
