**Operations Research by S D Sharma PDF** is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the basic concepts and methods of OR, such as linear programming, transportation and assignment problems, network analysis, game theory, dynamic programming, and inventory models. Part II deals with advanced topics such as nonlinear programming, integer programming, goal programming, queuing theory, simulation, Markov chains, and reliability theory. Part III presents some applications of OR in areas such as project management, production planning and control, scheduling, quality control, and operations management. Part IV provides some case studies and solved examples to illustrate the practical use of OR techniques.
 
**Operations Research by S D Sharma PDF** is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of mathematics, statistics, engineering, management, and other related disciplines. It can also be used as a reference book by researchers and practitioners who are interested in OR. The book is written in a clear and concise manner, with plenty of examples, diagrams, tables, and exercises. The book also includes some software packages such as LINDO, LINGO, TORA, and MATLAB to help the readers solve OR problems using computers.
