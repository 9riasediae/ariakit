# Lesson 5 Homework Practice Direct Variation Answer Key
 
In this lesson, you will learn how to identify and solve direct variation problems. A direct variation is a relationship between two quantities that change at the same rate. For example, if y varies directly as x, then y = kx for some constant k. The constant k is called the constant of variation or the slope of the graph.
 
To find the constant of variation, you can use the formula k = y/x. To solve a direct variation problem, you can use the equation y = kx and substitute the given values of x and y. Then, you can solve for the unknown variable or the constant of variation.

1. If y varies directly as x and y = 15 when x = 3, find y when x = 5.
2. Solution: First, find the constant of variation using k = y/x. Substitute the given values of x and y: k = 15/3 = 5. Then, use the equation y = kx and substitute the values of k and x: y = 5 \* 5 = 25. The answer is y = 25.
3. If y varies directly as x and y = 24 when x = 8, find x when y = 18.
4. Solution: First, find the constant of variation using k = y/x. Substitute the given values of x and y: k = 24/8 = 3. Then, use the equation y = kx and substitute the values of k and y: 18 = 3 \* x. Divide both sides by 3 to get x: x = 18/3 = 6. The answer is x = 6.
5. If y varies directly as x and k = 4, find y when x = 10.
6. Solution: Use the equation y = kx and substitute the values of k and x: y = 4 \* 10 = 40. The answer is y = 40.

Another way to identify a direct variation is to look at the graph of the relationship. A direct variation has a straight line graph that passes through the origin (0,0). The slope of the line is equal to the constant of variation k. You can use the slope formula to find the constant of variation from two points on the line: k = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1).
 
Here are some examples of how to graph a direct variation and find the constant of variation:

1. Graph y = 2x and find k.
2. Solution: To graph y = 2x, you can plot two points on the line by choosing values for x and finding y. For example, if x = 0, then y = 2 \* 0 = 0. If x = 2, then y = 2 \* 2 = 4. Plot the points (0,0) and (2,4) and draw a line through them. The graph passes through the origin and has a positive slope. To find k, you can use the slope formula with any two points on the line: k = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (4 - 0) / (2 - 0) = 2. The answer is k = 2.
3. Graph y = -3x and find k.
4. Solution: To graph y = -3x, you can plot two points on the line by choosing values for x and finding y. For example, if x = 0, then y = -3 \* 0 = 0. If x = -1, then y = -3 \* (-1) = 3. Plot the points (0,0) and (-1,3) and draw a line through them. The graph passes through the origin and has a negative slope. To find k, you can use the slope formula with any two points on the line: k = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (3 - 0) / (-1 - 0) = -3. The answer is k = -3.
